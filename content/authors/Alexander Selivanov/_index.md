I am a Ph.D. student at the AI in Medicine Lab, supervised by Prof. Dr. Daniel RÃ¼ckert at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My research focuses on multimodal deep learning approaches for predicting cardiovascular diseases, utilizing MRI, Ultrasound, and ECG data. I hold a Master's in Data Science from Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech), where I designed a framework for Medical Image Captioning of X-rays using GPT models, published in the Nature Scientific Reports Journal. Previously, I worked as an AI Scientist at Philips Research Laboratories, developing advanced image improvement frameworks for medical imaging. Currently, my research focuses on a contrastive learning approach that synchronizes ECG data with Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR) data to enrich ECG embeddings, enhancing cardiac health assessments.
