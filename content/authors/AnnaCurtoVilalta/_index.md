Anna is a doctoral candidate at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (TUM) and the Department of Orthopaedics and Sports Orthopaedics in Klinikum rechts der Isar. Before starting her PhD, she earned her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Biomedical Engineering. Throughout her Master's studies, she specialized in computer science and artificial intelligence, culminating in a thesis exploring unsupervised, multi-modal deep learning methodologies for bone tumor segmentation. Her current research centers on developing multi-modal foundational models for analyzing and diagnosing musculoskeletal tumors.
