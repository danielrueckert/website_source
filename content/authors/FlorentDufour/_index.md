I am a Ph.D. student at the Institute of AI in Healthcare and Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Daniel Rückert and PD Dr. Georgios Kaissis. I completed my undergraduate studies at the intersection of France, Germany, and Switzerland, where I studied biotechnology and data science for healthcare. Before engaging in my Ph.D., I joined the Big Data and AI team at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre to build a pilot Trusted Research Environment (TRE) for cardiovascular disease in the scope of the [DigiMed Bayern Project](https://digimed-bayern.de). Currently, I am working on privacy-enhancing technologies like differential privacy and confidential computing. I am exploring ways to use them to build trustworthy, secure, and robust machine learning systems.
