Florian is currently an affiliated researcher at the Lab for AI in Medicine and serves as the group leader for 'AI in Orthopaedics (AIO)' at the Department for Orthopaedics and Sports Orthopaedics at Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universität München (TUM). He holds a Bachelor's degree in Medical Computer Sciences from OTH Regensburg, where he specialized in nuclear medicine and radiology, and a Master of Science in Biomedical Computing from TUM, focusing on deep learning applications and optoacoustic imaging. From 2017 to 2020, he served as an IT coordinator at the Central Institute of Translational Cancer Research (TranslaTUM) at TUM. His PhD research, which he is expected to complete in 2024, is centered on the use of machine learning for the analysis and diagnosis of musculoskeletal tumours. His work emphasizes the comprehensive understanding of data origins, data engineering, and the application of task specific multimodal machine learning in a clinical setting, fostering close collaboration with clinicians.
