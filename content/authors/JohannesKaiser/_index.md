I’m a PhD student affiliated with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Before starting my PhD, I received an MSc in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence, as well as an MSc in Robotics and Mechatronics from TUM. My research interest is in the broad field of trustworthy AI, including fairness, privacy, memorization, and model multiplicity, with applications in the medical domain.
