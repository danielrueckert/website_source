I’m a Ph.D. student co-supervised by Prof. Daniel Rückert (AI for Medicine) and Prof. MD Jan Kirschke (Neuroradiology), working as part of the iBack-epic project that uses image analysis to understand the causes of back pain. I received my M.Sc. in Informatics from TUM, where I wrote my thesis on GNNs for robotic planning in collaboration with the German Aerospace Center (DLR). In the past, I held research and development positions in the cybersecurity industry, most recently as a research team leader at Argus Cyber Security Ltd (acquired by Continental AG). My previous medical imaging projects included generating counterfactuals for X-ray classifiers and grading vertebral fractures. I’m interested in diagnosing abnormalities in the spine from MRI and, specifically, how to use latent spaces of generative models for this task.
