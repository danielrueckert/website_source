I’m a PhD student affiliated with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). Before starting my PhD, I received a MSc. in Robotics, Cognition and Intellignce, as well as a BSc. in Medical Engineering from FAU. My research interest is in the broad field of multi-modal foundation models as well as generative AI for medical image and volumetric reconstruction.
