I'm a PhD student at the Institute of Radiology and Artificial Intelligence and the Institute of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine of the Technical University of Munich (TUM). 
Before starting my PhD, I received both, my BSc. and MSc. degree, in Management and Technology from TUM. In my Master's thesis, I worked on differential privacy: I used a non-learned feature extractor to improve the trade-off between privacy and utility in a real-world medical imaging dataset. 
My research now focuses on the intersection between interpretability and uncertainty quantification to build robust and trustworthy DL models; more specifically, I'm looking into inherently interpretable DL models and uncertainty quantification methods to distinguish aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
