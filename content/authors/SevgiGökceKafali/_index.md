Sevgi Gokce Kafali, PhD is a researcher at the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics in Medicine in Technical University of Munich. Her research interests include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly deep-learning based segmentation and image reconstruction using motion correction. The representative applications could be in liver and cardiac imaging. Previously, she gained her MS and PhD degrees in Bioengineering and Biomedical Engineering from University of California, Los Angeles. During her PhD, she focused on abdominal adipose tissue segmentation and radial free-breathing liver magnetic resonance elastography in children to manage steatotic liver disease.
