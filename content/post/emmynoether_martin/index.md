Martin Menten has been accepted into the prestigious Emmy Noether Programme by the German Research Foundation (https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/emmy-noether). The award will enable Martin to establish his own independent research group at the Institute for AI in Healthcare and Medicine. Over the course of the six-year project, he and his team will investigate strategies to harness multimodal learning signals for accurate, efficient, and interpretable deep learning for the fields of ophthalmology and neurology.
