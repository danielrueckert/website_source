Yesterday, we welcomed the CEO of Alphabet and Google, Sundar Pichai, to TUM and our Lab for AI in Medicine located at the University Hospital rechts der Isar. We were happy to showcase some of the exciting work on AI, cloud computing and genomics at TUM, followed by a fruitful discussion on how we can work together to accelerate the translation of these developments for the benefit of patients. Thank you for taking the time to visit us!
