## Abstract:
The detection and segmentation of bone tumors using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have crucial implications for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. With the advent of deep learning techniques, there's a growing interest in leveraging these methods to analyze MRI bone tumor images. However, a fundamental question arises: Is 3D volumetric processing superior to traditional 2D slice-by-slice processing in deep learning tasks for MRI bone tumor analysis? This research addresses this question by evaluating the effectiveness of 2D versus 3D deep learning methodologies.
<br/>

## Methodology:
The methodology involves implementing several deep-learning models to compare the efficacy of 2D and 3D techniques for MRI bone tumor analysis:
-   Literature review on the current state-of-the-art techniques in 2D and 3D MRI-based detection and segmentation tasks using deep learning.
-   Implement tumor detection and segmentation models in both 2D and 3D.
-   Explore and implement a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both 2D and 3D processing methods to achieve superior results.
-   Presenting and discussing results.
<br/>

## Prerequisites:
-   Advanced knowledge of deep learning with imaging data;
-   Beneficial but not necessary: experience in medicine/oncology;
-   Preferred starting date: September 2024 (with flexibility);
<br/>

## What we offer:
-   Very rare medical data with high potential for publication.
-   Highly educated & interdisciplinary environment.
-   Top-level hardware for scientific computing.
-   Constant feedback from medical and computer science experts
