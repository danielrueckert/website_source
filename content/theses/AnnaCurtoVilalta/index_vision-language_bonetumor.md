## Abstract:
Bone tumor classification presents significant challenges due to the subtle visual differences among tumor entities, even for expert radiologists. This thesis aims to enhance diagnostic capabilities using vision-language pretraining to classify bone tumors from X-ray images. By pretraining on large datasets and incorporating anatomical context through captions, this thesis seeks to address key limitations posed by data scarcity and anatomical heterogeneity in the field of bone tumors. 
<br/>

## Methodology:
-   Literature review on the current state-of-the-art techniques for bone tumor classification and self-supervised vision-language pretraining.
-   Implement a supervised learning model for bone tumor classification using X-Rays which will serve as a baseline.
-   Pretrain a vision-language model in a self-supervised manner, which will serve as a general-purpose model for downstream task.
-   Test several fine-tuning strategies for bone tumor classification and test zero-shot capabilities.
<br/>

## Prerequisites:
-   Advanced knowledge of deep learning with imaging data.
-   Beneficial but not necessary: experience in medicine/oncology.
-   Preferred starting date: January-February 2025 (with flexibility).
<br/>

## What we offer:
-   Very rare medical data with high potential for publication.
-   Highly educated & interdisciplinary environment.
-   Top-level hardware for scientific computing.
-   Constant feedback from medical and computer science experts.
