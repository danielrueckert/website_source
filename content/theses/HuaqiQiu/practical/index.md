This year's seminar will look at aspects of multi-modal machine learning in medicine and healthcare, focusing on:

- Vision language models (VLMs) for medical and healthcare applications
- Generic multi-modal AI models utilising imaging data, clinical reports, lab test results, electronic health records, and genomics
- Foundation models for multi-modal medicine


## Objectives:
At the end of the module students should have:
- a thorough understanding of current research in multi-modal AI in medicine, in particular about foundation models and large vision-language models and their impact in medicine
- After course completion students should be able to apply learned concepts, critically evaluate research works in the area, and be able to conceptualise strategies to tackle the issues discussed


 ## Methods:
- Each student will choose one paper from a provided list of papers, read it, and give a 15-minute presentation about the paper during the seminar sessions
- All students are expected and highly encouraged to participate in discussions during the seminar sessions
- Each student will then write a 2-page report after presenting and discussing the paper


## Prerequisites:
Students are expected to be familiar with:
- Mathematics basics (graduate level):
    - probability theory
    - linear algebra
    - calculus
- Machine / deep learning basics, e.g. having completed:
    - Machine Learning (IN2064)
    - Introduction to Deep Learning

<br> 

Preference might be given to students with:
- Knowledge in deep learning models in medicine, especially vision and/or language models
- Completion of related courses from our chair, e.g.:
    - AI in Medicine I
    - AI in Medicine II
- Work experience in AI / Data Science for Medicine & Healthcare
