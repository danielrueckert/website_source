In this master's thesis, we aim to explore the potential of leveraging multiple data entries per contributor across various medical datasets (ex. Chexpert) while maintaining differential privacy guarantees at the per-contributor level.

In sensitive domains like medicine, protecting the privacy of individuals contributing their data to research (e.g., for training neural networks) is of utmost importance.

Differential privacy [1] (the gold standard for privacy protection in deep learning) ensures that only a quantifiable and limited amount of a contributor's data is exposed as a result of their participation in a study. Commonly, differential privacy with contributor-level guarantees assumes that a database contains only a single entry per contributor. In cases where multiple entries exist for a contributor, the typical approach is to impose a limit on the number of entries and treat each individual as if they had contributed the maximum allowed number.

However, this approach presents two key problems:

1. Limiting the number of entries results in the loss of valuable data, reducing the expressiveness and utility of the remaining dataset.

2. Treating all individuals as if they provided the maximum allowed number of entries imposes unnecessarily strict privacy constraints on those who have contributed fewer entries.

This creates a trade-off between the amount of data discarded and the number of individuals whose data is processed under overly restrictive privacy guarantees.

In this thesis we want to explore a novel approach in employing individual-level differential privacy [2] to (1) use all the available data while (2) providing fitting privacy guarantees for any individual.
By leveraging this approach, we aim to achieve higher performance on medical datasets, improving the diagnostic accuracy while protecting the privacy of the contributors.
