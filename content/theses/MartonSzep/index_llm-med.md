## Description:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. In the medical field, these models hold the potential to revolutionize patient care, medical research, and healthcare administration. By leveraging LLMs, we can enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline administrative tasks, and provide personalized patient care. However, the integration of these models into medical practice poses unique challenges and opportunities that warrant thorough investigation.
Objective

The primary objective of this thesis is to develop and evaluate AI systems powered by Large Language Models that aid medical professionals in their work. Specific research topics and applications will be agreed upon with the student, allowing for a tailored approach that aligns with the student's interests and expertise. Potential areas of focus include (but are not limited to):
-   LLMs and Knowledge Graphs: Integrating LLMs with medical knowledge graphs to improve information retrieval and decision support.
-   Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Enhancing the generation capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external data sources.
-   Explainability: Developing methods to interpret and explain the outputs of LLMs to ensure transparency and trustworthiness in medical applications.
-   Uncertainty Quantification: Quantifying and communicating the uncertainty in LLM predictions to assist medical professionals in making informed decisions.
<br/>

## Methodology:
1. Literature review: A comprehensive literature review will be conducted to understand the current state of LLMs in medicine from the chosen perspective. 
2. Data collection and preprocessing: Utilizing real clinical data in German, provided by the institution. The data will be preprocessed and anonymized to ensure compliance with privacy regulations. If needed, this will be extended with public data.
3. Explore, implement and compare different approaches: Train and fine-tune LLMs. 
4. Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the developed systems through quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback from medical experts.
5. Discussion and presentation of results
